  <h1>Peanut Butter Cake</h1>

  <p>We love a good peanut butter and jelly sandwich here at Allrecipes.
    From cupcakes to chicken wings, we’ve found a way to PB&J-ify just about
    everything—or so we thought. When senior culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin
    saw content creator @holmescooking making a peanut butter and jelly poke cake
    on TikTok, she said exactly what we were all thinking: “How have we never thought
    of this one before?”</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (15.25 ounce) box vanilla cake mix</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cup peanut butter, divided</li>
    <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cup grape jelly, divided</li>
    <li>8 ounces whipped topping</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped peanuts</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
    <li>Add cake mix, 1 cup peanut butter, butter, eggs. and milk to a bowl, and stir until well combined. Batter may be
      slightly lumpy. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let stand
      for 10 minutes. </li>
    <li>Use the handle of a wooden spoon to poke holes into the cake. Melt 1 cup jelly in the microwave until pourable,
      1 to 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds. Spread jelly over warm cake with a spatula and work jelly down into the
      holes. Let cake cool completely. </li>
    <li>Spread whipped topping over cake; refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
    <li>Microwave remaining 1/4 cup peanut butter and 1/4 cup jelly until just pourable; drizzle cake with peanut butter
      and jelly and sprinkle with peanuts to serve.</li>
  </ol>
