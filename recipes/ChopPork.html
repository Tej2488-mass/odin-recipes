  <h1>Breaded Air Fryer Pork Chops</h1>
  <img src="./Chop Pork.webp" alt="A complete breaded air fryer pork chop dish">
  <p>These breaded pork chops, made in the air fryer, are perfectly tender and juicy. They require basic pantry
    ingredients and take just 10 minutes to cook. I like to use a Misto sprayer with my own oil, but feel free to use
    regular cooking spray.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 (5 ounce) boneless, center-cut pork chops, 1-inch thick</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>
    <li>1 Â½ cups cheese and garlic croutons</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Place pork chops on a plate and season both sides with Cajun seasoning.</li>
    <li>Pulse croutons in a small food processor until fine; transfer to a shallow dish. Lightly beat eggs in a separate
      shallow dish. Working one at a time, dip pork chops into beaten egg, letting excess drip off; press into crouton
      breading to coat both sides and place breaded chop, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with remaining chops. Mist
      chops with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray and arrange chops in a single layer in the air fryer basket. You
      may have to do two batches depending on the size of your air fryer.</li>
    <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer for 5 minutes; flip chops and mist again with cooking spray if there are dry
      areas. Cook 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chops should read 145
      degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
